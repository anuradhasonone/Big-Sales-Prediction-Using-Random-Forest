# Big-Sales-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest

Converting data into an appropriate form using various preprocessing techniques for the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms. Finding critical features that will most influence sales of the product. To determine the appropriate Machine Learning algorithm for sales forecasting.

In this project we will analysis the big sale prediction using random forest regression. In random forest regression is a tree-based algorithm wherein a certain number of decision trees are combined to make a powerful prediction model. firstly get the data and describe and define x and y variable and perform a train test split and after this model and prediction after evaluate the model.
